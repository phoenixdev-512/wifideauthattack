### For Security Researchers

If you discover a vulnerability in the code that could:
- Enable unauthorized access or attacks
- Bypass safety mechanisms
- Expose sensitive information
- Create legal/ethical concerns

Please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. **DO NOT** exploit the vulnerability
3. **DO** report it privately via GitHub Security Advisories
4. **DO** provide detailed information to help us understand and fix the issue

### What to Include in Your Report

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fixes (if any)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Our Commitment

When you report a vulnerability, we commit to:

2. **Understand the legal implications**
   - Research laws in your jurisdiction
   - Consult legal counsel if uncertain
   - Document your authorization

3. **Use in controlled environments**
   - Isolated test networks
   - Educational lab settings
   - Authorized security assessments

### During Use

1. **Maintain audit logs**
   - Record when and where testing occurs
   - Document authorization
   - Note any findings

2. **Minimize impact**
   - Test during off-peak hours (if applicable)
   - Limit attack duration
   - Notify relevant parties before testing

3. **Stop immediately if**
   - You lose authorization
   - Unexpected issues occur
   - Legal concerns arise

### After Use

1. **Report findings responsibly**
   - Notify network owners of vulnerabilities
   - Provide recommendations for remediation
   - Do not publicly disclose without permission

2. **Secure your findings**
   - Protect sensitive information
   - Do not share attack details publicly
   - Follow responsible disclosure practices

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow a **90-day disclosure timeline**:

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported to maintainers
2. **Day 1-7**: Initial assessment and acknowledgment
3. **Day 7-60**: Development and testing of fix
4. **Day 60-90**: Coordinated release and disclosure
5. **Day 90+**: Public disclosure (if not already released)

We may request an extension in complex cases and will work with reporters to coordinate disclosure timing.

## Security Contact

For security-related concerns:
- Use GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- Open a private issue for urgent matters
- Tag with `security` label

## Known Limitations

This tool has the following known limitations by design:

1. **Educational scope**: Designed for learning, not production security tools
2. **No stealth features**: Intentionally visible to promote ethical use
3. **Limited attack surface**: Focused on deauthentication only
4. **User interaction required**: No automated or scheduled attacks

These limitations are intentional to promote responsible use.

## Acknowledgments

We thank the security research community for responsible disclosure practices and helping keep this project safe and ethical.
