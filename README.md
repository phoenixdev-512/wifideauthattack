# Wi-Fi Security Monitor 🚀🌐🔒

## Overview 🌟🛡️💡
Wi-Fi Security Monitor is a tool designed to detect and alert network administrators about potential deauthentication (deauth) attacks. It passively listens to Wi-Fi traffic and identifies malicious deauth packets that may indicate an unauthorized attempt to disrupt network connections. 🛡️💻🔥

## Features 🌟🛠️🔧
- **Deauth Attack Detection**: Monitors for deauthentication packets on the network.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Notifies the user when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Logging & Analysis**: Records attack patterns for further investigation.
- **Legally Compliant**: Designed for ethical use by network administrators to protect against threats.

## Legal Disclaimer 📖🚫🏢
This tool is intended **only for educational and security testing purposes** by **authorized network administrators** on **networks they own or have explicit permission to test**. Unauthorized use of deauth attack tools on networks you do not own is illegal and may result in legal consequences. 🚫📝🔑

## Requirements 🛠️👨‍🔧🔍
- **Hardware**: ESP32 (or similar Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller)
- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support
  - Wireshark (optional, for packet analysis)
  
## Installation 📝🛠️🌟
1. **Set Up ESP32 in Arduino IDE**:
   - Install the ESP32 board support package.
   - Install necessary libraries (`WiFi.h`, `esp_wifi.h`).
2. **Flash the Code**:
   - Upload the detection script to your ESP32.
3. **Monitor the Serial Output**:
   - Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE at **115200 baud rate** to see detected attacks.

## Usage 🛡️💻🔍
1. **Power on ESP32** and connect it to the monitored network.
2. **Start Monitoring**: The tool will listen for deauth packets in real-time.
3. **Receive Alerts**: If a deauth attack is detected, the tool will log details and alert the user. 🛡️🌐🔍

## Future Enhancements 🌟👨‍🔧💡
- **Email/SMS Alerts** for remote notifications.
- **Integration with Firewalls** to automatically block rogue devices.
- **AI-based Threat Detection** for smarter attack prevention. 🤖🔓🌐
