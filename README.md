Wi-Fi Security Monitor
Overview
The Wi-Fi Security Monitor is an educational tool designed to assist network administrators in identifying potential deauthentication (deauth) attacks within a Wi-Fi network. By passively monitoring network traffic, it detects malicious deauthentication packets that may indicate unauthorized attempts to disrupt legitimate connections.

Features
Deauthentication Attack Detection: Identifies and logs deauthentication packets in real-time.

Alert System: Provides immediate notifications upon detecting suspicious activity.

Logging & Analysis: Maintains records of detected events for further security analysis.

Ethical Compliance: Strictly intended for authorized security testing and educational purposes.

Legal Disclaimer
This tool is exclusively intended for:

Educational use in controlled environments.

Security testing by authorized personnel on networks with explicit permission.

Unauthorized use on networks not owned or permitted for testing is illegal and may result in legal consequences.

Requirements
Hardware
ESP32 (or equivalent Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller)

Software
Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support

Required Libraries:

WiFi.h

esp_wifi.h

(Optional) Wireshark for packet analysis

Installation
Configure ESP32 in Arduino IDE

Install the ESP32 board support package.

Add necessary libraries (WiFi.h, esp_wifi.h).

Upload the Firmware

Compile and flash the detection script to the ESP32.

Monitor Output

Open the Serial Monitor (baud rate: 115200) to observe detection logs.

Usage
Deploy the Device

Connect the ESP32 to the network being monitored.

Initiate Monitoring

The tool will passively scan for deauthentication packets.

Review Alerts

Detected threats will be logged with timestamps and source details.

Future Enhancements
Automated Notifications: Email/SMS alerts for remote monitoring.

Firewall Integration: Automated blocking of suspicious devices.

Advanced Detection: Machine learning for improved threat classification.

Contribution
Contributions to enhance detection accuracy or add defensive features are welcome. Submit issues or pull requests via the project repository.
